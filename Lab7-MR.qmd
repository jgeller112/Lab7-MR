In this lab, you will be analyzing data from the study by [@hamermesh2005], which investigated various factors influencing teaching evaluation scores. Your task is to create a multiple regression model and write a comprehensive "Results and Discussion" section based on your analysis. Follow these guidelines:

1.  **Data Source**: Use the dataset provided . Ensure you are familiar with the dataset's variables and their meanings (see table below).

2.  **Variable Selection**: Select at least three predictors for your regression model. Focus on non-categorical variables.

3.  **Modeling and Analysis**: Develop a multiple regression model. Ensure you conduct and report the following:

    -   **Assumption Checks**: Conduct checks for linearity, normality, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and outliers. Describe how you addressed any violations. If normality is violated, ignore that for now, but please note it.

    -   **Statistical Tests**: Include F-tests and adjusted $R^2$ for overall model. For invidual predictors, reprot unstandardized regression coefficients, 95% CIs, t-tests and partial or semi-partial coefs.

4.  **Visualizations**: Include a partial regression plot for significant relationships.

5.  **Results and Discussion Section**: Write a section that includes:

    -   An overview of your model choice and the rationale behind selecting specific variables.

    -   A discussion of assumption checks and how any violations were addressed, if they were (ignore normality for now).

    -   A presentation of your model's results, including statistical tests.

    -   Interpretation of the results: Discuss what your findings imply about the factors affecting teaching evaluation scores.

    Structure your "Results and Discussion" section clearly. Use tables and figures where appropriate to present your data and findings. Ensure that your statistical results are presented in a readable and organized manner.
